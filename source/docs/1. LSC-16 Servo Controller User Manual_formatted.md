### 1.6.2 Deviation Judgment

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image82.png" class="common_img" />

(1) If the servo returns to the neutral position as shown in the figure below, no adjustment is needed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image83.jpeg" class="common_img" />

(2) If the angle between the servo arm and the servo in the horizontal plane is less than 13 degrees, it can be adjusted to return to the neutral position via the PC software. It is a small deviation and can be adjusted based on [1.6.3 Small Deviation Adjustment](). The deviation is as follows:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image84.jpeg" class="common_img" />

(3) If the angle between the servo arm and the servo in the horizontal plane is greater than 13 degrees, it cannot be adjusted to return to the neutral position via the PC software. It is a large deviation and can be adjusted based on [1.6.4 Large Deviation Adjustment](). The deviation is as follows:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image85.jpeg" class="common_img" />

### 1.6.3 Small Deviation Adjustment

The small deviation can be directly adjusted by dragging the deviation slider of the servo on the PC software interface.

:::{Note}

The adjustable range is between -100 and 100. If the servo arm can be adjusted to be parallel to the servo in the horizontal plane within this range, it is a small deviation. If the adjustment range exceeds this range, it is a large deviation. Please refer to [1.6.4 Large Deviation Adjustment]() to adjust.
:::

(1) Please refer to [1.3.1 Setup PC Software Control Environment]() to connect the servo controller and the servo to the PC.Select servo 1. The number can be checked based on the actual situation.
